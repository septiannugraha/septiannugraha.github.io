excerpt: "My past projects are mostly outdated or can't be accessed anymore. It becomes necessary to rebuild them"
---

I haven't gotten around building a web for showcasing my portfolio until early 2023, when I learned about building static sites with Jekyll and Github Pages. I realized that to convince potential clients, I need to showcase my past projects. Unfortunately, the codebases for the clients' projects are either not accessible anymore or just outdated. 

Furthermore, I have to rely on clients' infrastructure to host the projects, since I don't run my own private server. Of course, running my own private server has its own considerations, mainly in cost. As I can't really perceive any income coming from running a private server, I need to at least have some kind of free-tier options to gauge the potential of earning from providing online services.

# Building Systems That Scale 🚀

Hi, I'm **Septian Adi Nugraha** - a full-stack developer who turns spreadsheet chaos into scalable systems. Based in Jakarta, I build everything from enterprise risk management platforms to AI-powered narrative engines.

## 🎯 What I Do

I specialize in solving complex problems that sit at the intersection of business logic and technical architecture. Whether it's migrating 2,983 Excel formulas to a production database or building real-time systems for 200+ concurrent users, I deliver solutions that work.

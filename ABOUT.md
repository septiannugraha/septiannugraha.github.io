# About Me

## The Journey From Excel to Architecture

Hi! I'm Septian Adi Nugraha, a full-stack developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. My journey into software development started with a simple question: "Why does this Excel file take 8 hours to process?"

That question led me to migrate an enterprise system with 2,983 formulas across 36 Excel sheets into a proper web application. The result? The same process now takes 15 minutes. That experience taught me that most businesses are drowning in complexity that better architecture can solve.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of complex business logic and elegant technical solutions. Whether it's implementing 1000+ D&D rules in a combat simulator or building AI systems that maintain narrative consistency, I love turning chaos into clean, scalable systems.

My approach is simple:
1. **Understand the real problem** (not what they think it is)
2. **Build the simplest solution that works** (not the fanciest)
3. **Ship fast, iterate based on feedback** (not perfection)
4. **Document everything** (your future self will thank you)

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Boring technology that works** over trendy stacks
- **Clear code** over clever code
- **Shipping value** over architectural astronautics
- **Open source contribution** as a way to give back

## The Stack I Trust

After years of building production systems, here's what I reach for:

**For rapid development:** Node.js + PostgreSQL + Docker  
**For high performance:** Go + Redis + Kafka  
**For AI/ML projects:** Python + FastAPI + Gemini/Claude  
**For complex state:** Event sourcing + CQRS patterns  

## Current Focus

I'm currently:
- **Available for freelance work** (20 hours/week)
- **Building developer tools** (Excel migration toolkit)
- **Exploring AI narratives** (LLM orchestration)
- **Helping businesses escape spreadsheet hell**
